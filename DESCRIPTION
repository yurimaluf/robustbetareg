Description: Robust estimators for the beta regression, useful for modeling 
  bounded continuous data. Currently, four types of estimators are supported, 
  namely the LSMLE, the LMDPDE, the SMLE, and the MDPDE. All of these estimators
  depend on a tuning constant which may be fixed or selected by a data-driven
  algorithm also implemented in the package. Diagnostic tools associated with the
  fitted model, such as the residuals and goodness-of-fit statistics, are implemented.
  Finally, robust Wald-type tests are available.
