## Resubmission
This is a resubmission.

## NOTES
> Some code lines in examples are commented out.
Please never do that. Ideally find toy examples that can be regularly
executed and checked. Lengthy examples (> 5 sec), can be wrapped in
\donttest{}.
Examples in comments in:
       plot.robustbetareg.Rd
-> you still have "plot(hic)" in comment

Done. 

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
